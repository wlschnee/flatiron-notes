------------------

##### Objectives
 - Explain how dynamic routes prevent web apps from having to be constantly rewritten
 - Create dynamic routes

###### Dynamic Routes

```ruby
class Application

  @@songs = [Song.new("Sorry", "Justin Bieber"),
            Song.new("Hello","Adele")]

  def call(env)
    resp = Rack::Response.new
    req = Rack::Request.new(env)

    if req.path.match(/songs/)

      song_title = req.path.split("/songs/").last #turn /songs/Sorry into Sorry
      song = @@songs.find{|s| s.title == song_title}

      resp.write song.artist
    end

    resp.finish
  end
end
```
