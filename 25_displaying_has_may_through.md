Displaying Has Many Through
---------------------------

1. Construct a bi-directional `has_many_through`
2. Query for associations via the `belongs_to`, `has_many`, and `has_many_through` associations
3. Iterate over associations in a view and display associated data for a primary instance
4. Identify the join model in a `has_many_through`
