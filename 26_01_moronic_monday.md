#### Ruby #delegate ####

Tells a method if it doesn't know what to do with a message, forward it to something else.

[Rails #delegate](http://devdocs.io/rails~4.2/module#method-i-delegate)


#### Helpers ####

A place to put logic that makes some sense to put in the view.

Putting stuff in the view is messy and gross, so doing it in a helper makes it clean.

It's a module, but Rails goes and mixes it in to ActionView::Base
